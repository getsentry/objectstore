### Environment Setup

The considerations for setting up the development environment that can be found in the main [README](../README.md) apply for this package as well.

### Pre-commit hook

A configuration to set up a git pre-commit hook using [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) is available at the root of the repository.

To install it, run
```sh
pre-commit install
```

The hook will automatically run some checks before every commit, including the linters and formatters we run in CI.
